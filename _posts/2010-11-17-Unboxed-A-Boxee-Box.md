title: Unboxed A Boxee Box
---

I arrived home last night to my favorite sight, a box left by UPS. FedEx and DHL boxes are equally awesome. This one happened to be filled with the new [Boxee Box](http://www.boxee.tv/).

I've been looking for something besides cable TV to take up my viewing hours. After doing some research I had whittled my options down to either the [Boxee Box](http://www.boxee.tv/) or [Western Digital's TV Live Hub](http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.asp?driveid=891). Both of these boxes are $199.99 and look pretty comparable feature-wise. The WD's selling point over the Boxee Box seems to be that it has a 1TB drive built in. 

So why did I buy the Boxee Box then? A couple of reasons. One, It can play all standard and a lot of non-standard file formats for video, image, and audio. Secondly, this is what really sold me, you can develop apps for it! They have [Python](http://developer.boxee.tv/Python_API) and [JavaScript](http://developer.boxee.tv/JavaScript_API) API's. Boxee is also an open source project built on [XBMC](http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Main_Page). 

I'm excited to see how the Boxee matures, what it can do, and what people will come up with.
