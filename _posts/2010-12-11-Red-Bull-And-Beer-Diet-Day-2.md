**I am not a physician or a physical trainer or anything remotely close to that. I do not condone anyone putting themselves through what I will be doing for the next 3 days and as such cannot be held responsible for the consequences of doing so. If you do choose to do something as foolish as this please consult a physician so (s)he can talk you out of doing something so stupid. Lastly I do not condone underage consumption of alcohol.

**Log**  
8:30am Wake up well rested. Feel hungry, but no more then normal upon waking up.  
9:15am Starting to feel really hungry, but want to put off having anything to drink besides water until lunchtime.  
9:45am Took my morning weight reading. Im not sure how much is in error, but it looks as if I have lost a bit of lean mass and gained a bit of fat from yesterday. I took yesterdays reading in the evening which may be accounting for the differences. Will update this evening to make sure everything stays in sync and comparable.  
10:00am I figured out the discrepancy. Seems I recored my body stats from Thursday not Friday. Updated Day 1. This looks much better. Still will take reading this evening.  
12:00pm First Red Bull of the day.  
1:45pm Noticed that I think about eating when i'm bored. I didn't realize I ate so much to just fill time.  
2:15pm Getting really hungry. Feel slower and more tired then normal for a weekend afternoon.  
4:45pm Woke up from a nap. Super tired still and lazy think its Red Bull time to wake up.  
6:30pm Feeling woozy. I dont want to, but will be having a beer for calories to burn.  
6:45pm Weighed in again and updated body stats. This is the time that matches yesterday body stats.  
9:00pm My lack of energy has kept me from going out tonight.  
11:00pm Having a couple beers with friends while hot tubbing it up. A nice way to try and ignore the hunger.  
1:30am I dont know if it was the beers or the hot tub but i feel like a million bucks now. Bed soon.
